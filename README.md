# Spirits at  Prairie Creek Park [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spring2017gamestudio/prairie-creek.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spring2017gamestudio/prairie-creek)

This is a geolocative adventure game set at 
[Prairie Creek Reservoir](http://www.cityofmuncie.com/muncie-prairie-creek-reservoir-office.htm)
near Muncie, Indiana. This game has been developed by a multidisciplinary undergraduate
team at [Ball State University](http://bsu.edu) working under the direction of
[Paul Gestwicki](http://www.cs.bsu.edu/~pvg), in collaboration with
[Muncie Sanitary District](http://www.munciesanitary.org/)&mdash;specifically
[Camp Prairie Creek](http://www.munciesanitary.org/department-pages/stormwater/camp-prairie-creek),
a free summer camp for school-age children that features themes of water quality,
sustainability, environmentalism, and outdoorsmanship.

You can play the game for free online, but it is only playable at [Prairie Creek Park](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Prairie+Creek+Park/@40.1305419,-85.2978604,15z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x88153dbc662e6527:0x269343d76a2f29e5!2sPrairie+Creek+Reservoir!8m2!3d40.1225435!4d-85.2821016!3m4!1s0x0:0x5de41bebe474361b!8m2!3d40.1240078!4d-85.2818549).
Once you're near the park, you can load the game from
[https://spring2017gamestudio.github.io/prairie-creek/](https://spring2017gamestudio.github.io/prairie-creek/).
The game is designed to be played by families or small groups. We hope you enjoy it!
