# The Prairie Creek Game [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spring2017gamestudio/prairie-creek.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spring2017gamestudio/prairie-creek)

This is a locative adventure game set at Prairie Creek Reservoir
in Muncie.
It is based on the [Polymer Starter Kit](https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit).

## Notes from Polymer Starter Kit

### Build

This command performs HTML, CSS, and JS minification on the application
dependencies, and generates a service-worker.js file with code to pre-cache the
dependencies based on the entrypoint and fragments specified in `polymer.json`.
The minified files are output to the `build/unbundled` folder, and are suitable
for serving from a HTTP/2+Push compatible server.

In addition the command also creates a fallback `build/bundled` folder,
generated using fragment bundling, suitable for serving from non
H2/push-compatible servers or to clients that do not support H2/Push.

### Preview the build

This command serves the minified version of the app at `http://localhost:8080`
in an unbundled state, as it would be served by a push-compatible server:

    polymer serve build/unbundled

This command serves the minified version of the app at `http://localhost:8080`
generated using fragment bundling:

    polymer serve build/bundled

### Run tests

This command will run
[Web Component Tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester) against the
browsers currently installed on your machine.

### Adding a new view

You can extend the app by adding more views that will be demand-loaded
e.g. based on the route, or to progressively render non-critical sections
of the application.  Each new demand-loaded fragment should be added to the
list of `fragments` in the included `polymer.json` file.  This will ensure
those components and their dependencies are added to the list of pre-cached
components (and will have bundles created in the fallback `bundled` build).
